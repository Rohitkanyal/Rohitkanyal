About Me:
My name is Rohit Kanyal and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I have a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites using React and Angular. My online portfolio, located at https://rohitkanyalportfolio.netlify.app/, showcases some of my best work and demonstrates my skills as a Frontend Developer.

My journey in programming began with Python and I am proficient in HTML/CSS. I have experience working with different development environments such as PyCharm, Intelij, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom Editor. I pride myself on my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and ability to work in a team setting. I am a hard worker and am always ready to tackle any challenge, 24/7.

I am dedicated to becoming a better version of myself, both professionally and personally. My motto is to continuously grow and improve, and this is reflected in my portfolio, where you can find articles about my courses, fitness routines, and lifestyle.
